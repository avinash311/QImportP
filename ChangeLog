* Version 0.7

* Yahoo has disabled historical rates download, so removed support for /days:1
or higher number of days. /days:0 is default and will download current prices
only.
Google finance API has also been deprecated since 2011.
So there are no reliable sources of historical data anymore.

* Here's a web discussion on Yahoo discontinuing ichart support:
https://yahoo.uservoice.com/forums/382977-finance/suggestions/19310356-https-ichart-finance-yahoo-com-table-csv-s-spy-akk
Example:
http://ichart.finance.yahoo.com/table.csv?&s=VTSAX&a=04&b=30&c=2017&g=d
returns 404 error code now.

* Version 0.6

* Handle new text end-of-line for the /days:0 option URL download.finance.yahoo.com
(use just \n for line splitting, instead of \r\n used previously).

* Do not mix the two URLs: download.finance.yahoo.com (/days:0) and
ichart.finance.yahoo.com (/days:1 or higher). They may return values
in different units (pence vs pounds, for example in UK).
Now depending on value of /days:value, only one of the URLs is called.

* Removed /div100 option and replaced with general /div:value argument.
So replacement is /div:100 and can specify any divisor.

* Version 0.5

* Example QImportP.cmd.txt was missing a @REM after /automate help line.
Renamed QImportP.bat.txt to QImportP.cmd.txt

* Support for Vista64 based on comment at:
http://www.aczoom.com/archive-2016/consumer/import-prices-script-for-quicken/index.html#comment-5551
Still, it is best to have Quicken started before running script for things
like password-protected Quicken files.

* README updated with instructions on how to add shortcut to Start menu,
which may be preferable to hacking Quicken.ini file.

2009-06-01

* Version 0.4.0

* Automation now handles file/directory names with special characters
like ~ + ! ^ {SPACE} {TAB}

* README updated with instructions on how to add toolbar icon
to run QImportP.cmd.

2009-05-19

* Version 0.3.0

* Automation change to use ^u instead of alt-i since alt-i brings up 
Find dialog if a register is open.

* Option added for GBP (UK, and probably other places too). Use
/gbp option.  Updates from:

2009-03-22

* Version 0.2.0

* QImportP.bat.txt - Added example batch script for end-user editing.
* new options /daily  /weekly  /monthly  /days:n  /help

2009-03-14

* Version 0.1.0
