* Version 2.10

* Added support for alphavantage.co API using their TIME_SERIES_DAILY
  API to download current and historical quotes.

* Both /gscv and /avkey can be used in one invocation to download prices
  from Google Spreadsheet as well as AlphaVantage.co

* google finance has disabled support for both
  https://www.google.com/finance?q=VTSAX  and finance.google.com so that code
  does not work anymore and will soon be removed.

2017-12-04

* Version 2.00

* Added support for CSV download. This can be used to create a Google
  Spreadsheet with 
  Example spreadsheet:
  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yzIpQRdfJh5hm5y9tF7LW060eLH8rkXr7PW4SFwkLlY/edit?usp=sharing
  To download as CSV URL for above spreadsheet, change /edit to:
  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yzIpQRdfJh5hm5y9tF7LW060eLH8rkXr7PW4SFwkLlY/export?format=csv
  See the example script QImportP.cmd.txt for details on using the /gcsv:
  argument.

* yahoo disabled support for
  http://download.finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?f=sl1d1hgv&e=.csv&s=VTSAX
  so /yahoo option no longer works and has been removed.

* google finance pages have changed, so the 1.0 version "screen scraping"
  method in  previous releases stopped working.
  This is used when /s: symbols option is used in the input.
  For now, it has been made to work again using a finance.google.com
  web url, but note that Google Finance has new pages in their Beta program,
  so this will stop working soon too.
  https://www.google.com/finance?q=VTSAX now returns 403 (forbidden)
  so that changed to use finance.google.com which as of now, still works.

* Version 1.51. Adds back support for current prices using Yahoo API
  Yahoo API is much faster since a single web request gets multiple symbol
  prices, and does not have to screen scrape.
  Added /yahoo option to force use of Yahoo API. This only supports current
  prices, does not support historical quotes.
  Additionally, Yahoo is more current (0-1 days old) vs Google (1-2 days old).
  Example:
  http://download.finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?f=sl1d1hgv&e=.csv&s=VTSAX
  vs
  https://www.google.com/finance?q=VTSAX
  Try those after couple of hours after market close, around 7PM using Mutual
  Fund symbols - Google quoted prices are much older than Yahoo quotes.

* Note that symbol names need to be different for Yahoo vs Google.
  See the description below (Version 1.0) for Google symbol names.
  Yahoo names can be found using their website, for example:
  CADUSD=X has to be used with /yahoo and CADUSD when /yahoo is not used.

2017-08-08

* New Major Version 1.0 (Because of significant logic changes in the method of getting prices)

* Remove need for API and use "screen scraping" methods to get prices directly from html
  This is to re-enable historical rates download allowing multiple days
  
* Use Google Finance as the source for prices (both daily and historic)
  It's easier to control history from google finance as the history url allows number of days as a parameter;

* Minor enhancements
  /dmy:format Option to allow any output date format to be specified (eg. D-M-Y, Y/M/D etc:-)
  /symonly Symbols in google format is MARKET:SYMBOL but this option removes market from output (eg. LON:LLOY outputs LLOY)
           Note. In google you dont have to specify exchange but if you don't, you may get the wrong one!
   each symbol can have a "!" prefix to ignore the /div:xxx settings for this stock 
    (eg. /div:100 s:LON:LLOY,!LONINDEX:ASX), only the LONINDEX:ASX will ignore div:100
  /noget option is removed
  
2017-06-02

* Version 0.7

* Yahoo has disabled historical rates download, so removed support for /days:1
or higher number of days. /days:0 is default and will download current prices
only.
Google finance API has also been deprecated since 2011.
So there are no reliable sources of historical data anymore.

* Here's a web discussion on Yahoo discontinuing ichart support:
https://yahoo.uservoice.com/forums/382977-finance/suggestions/19310356-https-ichart-finance-yahoo-com-table-csv-s-spy-akk
Example:
http://ichart.finance.yahoo.com/table.csv?&s=VTSAX&a=04&b=30&c=2017&g=d
returns 404 error code now.

2015-04-09

* Version 0.6

* Handle new text end-of-line for the /days:0 option URL download.finance.yahoo.com
(use just \n for line splitting, instead of \r\n used previously).

* Do not mix the two URLs: download.finance.yahoo.com (/days:0) and
ichart.finance.yahoo.com (/days:1 or higher). They may return values
in different units (pence vs pounds, for example in UK).
Now depending on value of /days:value, only one of the URLs is called.

* Removed /div100 option and replaced with general /div:value argument.
So replacement is /div:100 and can specify any divisor.

2009-11-24

* Version 0.5

* Example QImportP.cmd.txt was missing a @REM after /automate help line.
Renamed QImportP.bat.txt to QImportP.cmd.txt

* Support for Vista64 based on comment at:
http://www.aczoom.com/archive-2016/consumer/import-prices-script-for-quicken/index.html#comment-5551
Still, it is best to have Quicken started before running script for things
like password-protected Quicken files.

* README updated with instructions on how to add shortcut to Start menu,
which may be preferable to hacking Quicken.ini file.

2009-06-01

* Version 0.4.0

* Automation now handles file/directory names with special characters
like ~ + ! ^ {SPACE} {TAB}

* README updated with instructions on how to add toolbar icon
to run QImportP.cmd.

2009-05-19

* Version 0.3.0

* Automation change to use ^u instead of alt-i since alt-i brings up 
Find dialog if a register is open.

* Option added for GBP (UK, and probably other places too). Use
/gbp option.  Updates from:
http://www.aczoom.com/archive-2016/consumer/import-prices-script-for-quicken/index.html#comment-5535


2009-03-22

* Version 0.2.0

* QImportP.bat.txt - Added example batch script for end-user editing.
* new options /daily  /weekly  /monthly  /days:n  /help

2009-03-14

* Version 0.1.0

* Created script.
